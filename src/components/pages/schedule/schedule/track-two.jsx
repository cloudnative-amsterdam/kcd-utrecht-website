      '<p>Have you ever been puzzled by terms like "Docker" and "Kubernetes"? If you have, you\'re not alone! In this lightning talk, let\'s simplify Docker and Kubernetes by using a simple analogy involving "boxes." and discover how Docker and Kubernetes can change the way you handle your projects. Bid farewell to the confusion and welcome the magic of containerization and automatic project management.</p>' +

      '<p class="text-sm font-normal text-gray-400">By Serdar Kalaycı</p>' +
      '<p>12 Factor App was first released 12 years ago, 3 years before Kubernetes was first released. Since then, the community has been eager to adopt Kubernetes itself as a platform, but the guideline to develop good cloud-native software has been neglected in comparison. Similar to the initial cloud movement, lifting and shifting existing workloads onto Kubernetes did not lead to cloud-native solutions, but made management and maintenance even more difficult. Today we will look at the lessons of the 12 Factor App and find out how these lessons make software run more smoothly on Kubernetes and how Kubernetes helps you develop 12 Factor Apps more easily.</p>' +

      '<p class="text-sm font-normal text-gray-400">By Jan Karremans</p>' +
      '<p>You are not really crazy, are you? Running your beloved database in Kubernetes? This infrastructure is built to break and my database should not break! What actually is this Cloud Native nonsense? The latest and greatest marketing gig, let’s get out our buzzword-bingo cards!<br/>' +
      'Or… should we? Join me for an exploration of Cloud Native, Data on Kubernetes, why databases in containers make much sense, and why much of the fear is from a previous era. In this talk, you will see why more and more organizations look at Cloud Native infrastructures for deploying critical data workloads. You will explore options and opportunities for creating modern application architectures without having to fall into a split between your application and your back end.</p>',
